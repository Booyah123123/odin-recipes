        <!-- Description -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried dumplings are a delicious appetizer or snack made by wrapping seasoned meat and vegetables in a thin 
            <br>dough and pan-frying them until crispy and golden on the outside. Often served with dipping sauce, these 
            <br>dumplings are common in Chinese takeout. Their crispiness makes them a popular and flavorful dish.
