# Odin Recipes
This is my first project from The Odin Project foundations course. The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using basic HTML syntax learned so far. It includes a main index page with links to individual recipe pages, each containing a description, image, ingredients list, and instructions.

## Summary of What I learned/What the Project Demonstrates
- How to structure HTML documents
- Creating links between pages 
- Inserting images
- Using ordered and unordered lists, as well as nested lists
- Organizing files and images in a directory
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Writing good commit messages and maintaining clean code
